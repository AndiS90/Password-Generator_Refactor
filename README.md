# Password-Generator_Refactor

<p> My personal objective in regard to this project was to create a simple tool through javascript that generates a strong and unpredictable password based on guidelines set by a user.
</p>

<p>
I did this by implementing various javascript loops and conditionals and by taking advantage of basic array properties.
</p>

<p>
The work on this project reinforced some of the basic necessities of javascript, such as backslashing out specific characters so they "remain" in a string, and being careful with your operators when iterating through the length of an array.
